About
=====

Halcyon is a platform-agnostic system for rapid deployment of [Haskell](http://haskell.org/) installations.

Please see the [Halcyon user’s guide](guide/) for an introduction to Halcyon concepts and modes of operation.

Interested in deploying Haskell web applications?  Try [Haskell on Heroku](http://haskellonheroku.com/).


Internals
---------

Halcyon is built with [_bashmenot_](http://bashmenot.mietek.io/), a library of functions for safer shell scripting.

For an in-depth discussion of Halcyon internals, please see the [Halcyon programmer’s reference](reference/).

Additional information is available in the [_bashnot_ programmer’s reference](http://bashnot.mietek.io/reference/).


Support
-------

Please report any problems with Halcyon on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mietek/halcyon/issues/).  There is a [separate issue tracker](https://github.com/mietek/halcyon-website/issues/) for problems with the documentation.

Commercial support for Halcyon is offered by [Least Fixed](http://leastfixed.com/), a functional software consultancy.
